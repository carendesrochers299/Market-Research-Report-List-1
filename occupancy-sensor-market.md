<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Occupancy Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PIR (passive infrared) Sensors</li><li>Ultrasonic Sensors</li><li>Dual-technology Occupancy Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The occupancy sensor market comprises three main types: PIR (passive infrared) sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and dual-technology occupancy sensors. PIR sensors detect heat emitted by people, activating lighting or HVAC systems based on occupancy. Ultrasonic sensors emit sound waves to detect movement, making them effective in complex spaces. Dual-technology sensors combine both PIR and ultrasonic technologies, enhancing accuracy by reducing false triggers. These sensors are widely used in commercial and residential applications for energy efficiency and improved user convenience.</p></p>
