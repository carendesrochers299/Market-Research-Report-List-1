<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Component</li><li>Multi Component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane sealants are versatile adhesives used for sealing joints and gaps, offering durability, flexibility, and resistance to weathering. The market is divided into two main types: **Single-Component** and **Multi-Component** sealants. Single-component sealants are pre-mixed, ready-to-use products that cure upon exposure to moisture, making them convenient for quick applications. Multi-component sealants require mixing of separate components (base and catalyst) before use, offering superior performance for demanding applications, such as industrial or structural bonding, where precise curing and enhanced properties are critical.</p></p>
